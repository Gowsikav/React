1. what is web application?

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a browser. It uses a client-server model, where the frontend runs in the browser and the backend runs on the server. Examples include Gmail, Facebook, and e-commerce sites. Web applications are dynamic, interactive, and require both frontend, backend, and database to work together.

2. what is web server?

A web server is software or hardware that stores and serves web content to users. When a browser sends a request, the web server processes it, executes backend code if needed, interacts with the database, and sends the response back. Examples are Apache, Nginx, and Tomcat.
     Why Do We Need a Web Server?

To host websites/web applications
To handle client requests
To run backend logic
To connect with databases
To deliver content to users

3. What is Frontend?

Frontend is the visual part of a web application — everything the user sees and interacts with in the browser.

4. What is Backend?

Backend is the logic part of the application — it runs on the server and manages how the system works behind the scenes.

Frontend is the part of a web application that the user interacts with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Backend is the server-side part that handles data, logic, authentication, and database operations. We need both because frontend provides user interface while backend handles processing, security, and data management. Together they make a complete web application.

-----------------------------------
Web Application

“A web application is an application that runs in a browser and is accessed by the user through the internet. It does not require installation; users interact with it using a web browser.”

⭐ Web Server

“A web server handles the requests sent from the browser and sends the appropriate response back. It processes backend code and delivers data or web pages to the client.”

⭐ Frontend

“Frontend is the client-side part of the application — the user interface. It includes everything the user sees and interacts with, like buttons, forms, layouts, and design.”

⭐ Backend

“Backend is the server-side part of the application. It handles business logic, processes data, communicates with the database, and sends results back to the frontend.”

5. What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of a webpage.
It defines the structure and content.
    Why HTML?
Because a browser needs a layout to display content.
Without HTML → nothing will show on the page.

6. What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the design of a webpage.
It makes the page look beautiful.
    Why CSS?
Because HTML alone looks plain and boring.
CSS makes the UI attractive and user-friendly.

7. what is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a webpage.
     Why JavaScript?
Because users need dynamic and interactive pages.
Without JS → page is static and cannot react to user actions.

HTML gives structure, CSS gives style, and JavaScript gives interactivity.
Together, they form the foundation of any web application. HTML builds the layout, CSS makes it look beautiful, and JavaScript makes the page dynamic and interactive.

BROWSER WORKFLOW (One-Line Version)

URL → DNS → TCP → HTTPS → Request → Web Server → Backend → DB → Response → DOM → CSSOM → Render Tree → Paint → JS Execution → Final UI

The browser workflow starts with DNS resolution, establishing a TCP/HTTPS connection, sending a request to the web server, which forwards it to the backend. After receiving the HTML/CSS/JS response, the browser builds the DOM, CSSOM, render tree, performs layout and painting, then executes JavaScript to finally render the web page.
